                <p>
                    At Invictus I was a part of a team of 7 interns working on two real-world software solutions. Chief among these was part of a contract for the US government, where
                    we trained out own custom AI model. This project ended up being valued at over <b>$250,000</b>. During my time at Invictus, I learned how to use AWS EC2, S3 buckets, CodeCommit, 
                    Git, and Docker. The primary programming languages I used were Go and Python and I specialized in backend development and design.

                At SWCCDC we were given a network consisting of multiple pre-configured services, competing against more than 15 other teams. Among the services we had to secure were a Gitlab, LDAP, webserver,
                and Active Directory. With no service uptimes below 50%, our team qualified to SWCCDC regionals by placing within the top 8 of teams at the qualifiers. During my time at the competition, I primarily
                focused on securing Linux machines and working on injects related to our Gitlab, runner, and webserver. This was done in association with Louisiana Tech University.

                My first experience in CCDC was the Western Regional Invitationals #1, where I was exposed to a larger network than at the NCAE Cyber Games consisting of both Linux and Windows servers. 
                At the competition, we were given pre-configured servers that were attacked by a professional red team. Our team managed to place 7th out of more than 26 teams, one place below Standford. 
                During my time at the competition, I primarily focused on defending Windows servers. This was done in association with Louisiana Tech University.

                            The scoring engine was a precursor to NEST, beginning development in December of 2023 and being archived in late 2024 as NEST began to take form. With a much smaller scope
                            than NEST, it focused on running inside an individual network, scoring services, storing the data, and representing it through a frontend using Python Flask and pure HTML + CSS.
                            I worked on the scoring engine with a small team of developers, initially starting out doing backend development with Go and ending up leading the project before creating NEST.
